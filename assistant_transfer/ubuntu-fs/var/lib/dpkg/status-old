Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: Standalone rescue shell with tons of builtin utilities
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.).  The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 busybox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell
 that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox. This package is
 intended to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your
 system. Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save
 your system from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the
 available builtin commands.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .
 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which programs are linked.

Description: Library for manipulating block devices
 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,
 LUKS or MD RAID.
 .
 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.

 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,

 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: run commands as another user with polkit authorization
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 pkexec is a setuid program to allow certain users to run commands as
 root or as a different user, similar to sudo. Unlike sudo, it carries
 out authentication and authorization by sending a request to polkit,
 so it uses desktop environments' familiar prompting mechanisms for
 authentication and uses polkit policies for authorization decisions.
 .
 By default, members of the 'sudo' Unix group can use pkexec to run any
 command after authenticating. The authorization rules can be changed by
 the local system administrator.
 .
 If this functionality is not required, removing the pkexec package will
 reduce security risk by removing a setuid program.

Description: framework for managing administrative policies and privileges
 PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 .
 It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to
 granting access to privileged operations for unprivileged (desktop)
 applications.
 .
 In a typical use of polkit, an unprivileged application such as gnome-disks
 sends requests via D-Bus or other inter-process communication mechanisms
 to a privileged system service such as udisks, which asks polkitd for
 permission to process those requests. This allows the application to carry
 out privileged tasks without making use of setuid, which avoids several
 common sources of security vulnerabilities.
 .
 This package provides the polkitd D-Bus service and supporting programs.
 The pkexec program is not included, and can be found in the pkexec package.

Description: D-Bus service to access and manipulate storage devices
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.
 .
 This package also provides the udisksctl utility, which can be used to
 trigger these operations from the command line (if permitted by
 PolicyKit).
 .
 Creating or modifying file systems such as XFS, RAID, or LUKS encryption
 requires that the corresponding mkfs.* and admin tools are installed, such as
 dosfstools for VFAT, xfsprogs for XFS, or cryptsetup for LUKS.

Description: Convert the system to the merged /usr directories scheme
 This package will automatically convert the system to the merged
 /usr directory scheme, in which the /{bin,sbin,lib}/ directories are
 symlinked to their counterparts in /usr/.
 .
 There is no automatic method to restore the precedent configuration, so
 there is no going back once this package has been installed.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.
